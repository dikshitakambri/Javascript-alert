# Contributing Guidelines

- Add single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- Pull request title should include resource name and resource section.
  - Example: `[Js file Added] -> [Filename]`

- Provide a link to submitted resource in pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.
  - Example: `Resource Link: https://github.com/bhargav-joshi`

- Double check if the resource is correct or not.
